# ComLog

## About

### tl;dr

Commit log service in Golang similar to what Kafka is (The goal is to make it distributed in the future)

### The goal of the project

- Implement a distributed commit log service with Golang
- Learn a lot about database concurrency, commit log, distributed systems...etc And most important one having fun üòÅÔ∏è

What is a commitLog ? some resources to check out if you are curious:

## Quick start

#### The Library Usage: [Library README](comLog/README.md)

## Tasks:

- [x] Write the commit log library (package)
- [ ] Write the rpc service to expose the library
- [ ] Write the service discovery logic for the distribution purpose
- [ ] Write the service coordination/consensus logic
